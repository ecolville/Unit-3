                        <h2>Hunger Facts</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Hunger can affect people from all walks of life. Millions of people in America are just one job loss, missed paycheck, or medical emergency away from hunger. But hunger doesn't affect everyone equally - some groups like children, seniors, Black, Indigenous, and other people of color face hunger much higher rates. Hunger also most often affects our neighbors who live in poverty.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hunger is a problem in both developed and developing countries. In 2020, an estimated 35 million people in the United States experienced food insecurity.</li>
                            <li>Hunger disproportionately affects children. Around 149 million children under the age of 5 are stunted due to malnutrition.</li>
                            <li>Hunger is a leading cause of death worldwide. It is estimated that hunger and malnutrition kill more people each year than AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis combined.</li>
                            <li>Women are more likely to experience hunger and malnutrition than men. This is partly due to gender inequalities in access to education, employment, and resources.</li>
                            <li>Climate change is exacerbating hunger and food insecurity in many parts of the world by reducing crop yields, increasing food prices, and causing natural disasters that destroy crops and infrastructure.</li>
                            <li>Hunger and malnutrition have long-term negative impacts on individuals, families, and communities. For example, malnourished children are more likely to have delayed cognitive development and chronic health problems in adulthood.</li>
                            <li>Hunger is preventable. Addressing hunger requires a comprehensive approach that includes improving access to food, promoting sustainable agriculture, increasing economic opportunities, and investing in education and healthcare.</li>

                        <p class="lead">Food insecurity refers to the lack of access to enough safe and nutritious food to meet one's dietary needs for an active and healthy life. It is a complex issue that can be caused by various factors such as poverty, unemployment, low wages, high food prices, limited access to supermarkets or grocery stores, inadequate social safety nets, and natural disasters. Food insecurity can lead to malnutrition, chronic diseases, poor physical and mental health, and other negative outcomes. It is a major global challenge, affecting millions of people around the world, and requires a multidisciplinary approach to address it.</p>
